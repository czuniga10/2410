Identifying Objects

Creative
Iterative
Different ways to help identify objects
Grammatical analysis
Paragraph written before you start coding can help identify what methods/fields might be needed
Identify tangible things in application domain

CRC Card

Class Responsibility Collaboration
Brainstorming tool
Identify classes and their interactions
Identify Classes - responsibilities - collaborators - move cards

Design Patterns

Are descriptions of the problem and the essence of its solutions
They describe will-tried solutions
They capture experience in a way that makes it possible for others to reuse it

Database

JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
API used to 
Connect to a datasource
Update and query

DBMS - DB management system - server mode - uses an outside service to store data
RDBMS Relations DB management system - embedded mode - stores data within the code
JavaDB
Open source Apache Derby db
Easy to use
Small footprint
Full feature set; fully transactional
Provides standard SQL interface and JDBC compliant driver
JavaDB - how it works
Uses try with resources because its autocloseable
Create connection object to connect to the database
Create a statement object to query/update the database
Use the resultSet object to process data

Stack/Queue

Stack
LIFO
Push
Pop
Peek
Often used to reverse a list of elements
Queue
FIFO
Enqueue
Dequeue
Peek

Generics

Understand type parameters
Avoid raw types
Know how to declare and instantiate object of a generic class
Know how to implement a generic interface
Iterable interface
Comparable interface

Linked Structures

List
Queue
Uses Nodes
Data
Next element

Iterator

What methods are needed when implementing this interface
hasnext()
next()
